Modeled a Quadcopter UAV in Gazebo, integrated with Hokuyo LiDAR and Ardupilot controller, interfaced with ROS.
Stabilized the video feed from the drone using the point feature matching algorithm using OpenCV with CV\_bridge.
Implemented the exploration module using the Rapidly-exploring Random Tree* (RRT*) algorithm for path planning.
Utilized Hector SLAM to generate the 2D map of the environment from LiDAR data and visualized the rendered map.
